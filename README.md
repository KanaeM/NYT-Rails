# New York Times Article Search

Recreating a previous project I worked on, [NYT React](https://github.com/KanaeM/NYT-React), to Ruby on Rails. The previous one was built with a MERN stack. 

Work in progress...

Notes:
* Fix search bar for NYT external API search (current one is a placeholder for now --not linked)
